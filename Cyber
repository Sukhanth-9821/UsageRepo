That error — “The object exporter specified was not found” — typically means WMI connectivity is partially working, but the remote call can’t complete because the dynamic DCOM port used for the WMI response is being blocked by a firewall.


---

Root Cause

WMI uses TCP port 135 to start the conversation and then switches to a random high-numbered dynamic port (typically between 49152–65535). If those dynamic ports are blocked, you get this lovely error.


---

Fix Options

Option 1: Open Firewall Ports

On the target machine, allow:

TCP 135 (WMI uses this for RPC endpoint mapper)

TCP 49152–65535 (default dynamic port range)


On both the Windows Defender Firewall and any network firewall in between.

You can check if they're open using:

Test-NetConnection <target> -Port 135


---

Option 2: Restrict WMI to Use a Fixed Port

If you can’t open the full dynamic range, you can force WMI to use a specific port (e.g., 24158). Here’s how:

Steps (on the target machine):

1. Open Command Prompt as Admin


2. Run:

netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange protocol=tcp startport=24158 numberofports=1


3. Set WMI to use that port:

winmgmt -standalonehost


4. Open Registry Editor (regedit)


5. Navigate to:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\Internet


6. Create a new DWORD:

Name: PortsInternetAvailable

Value: Y



7. Create a new Multi-String Value:

Name: Ports

Value: 24158



8. Create a new String Value:

Name: UseInternetPorts

Value: Y



9. Reboot the machine.


10. Allow TCP 135 and TCP 24158 in the firewall.

Option 3: Use PowerShell Remoting Instead (If Allowed)

If your org allows it, using PowerShell Remoting (Invoke-Command) over WinRM is more firewall-friendly.


---

Test Again After Fixing:

Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName <target> -Credential (Get-Credential)

Let me know if you want a GPO-based method for pushing this config across multiple machines or if you’re doing this on a single host manually.
